  "body": "Equip is a web application that churns out custom packing lists for various outdoor activities. The user can choose their type of activity, the weather they expect, and how long they plan on going. With that user input, pack lists are tailored and then presented. Users can then follow links to purchase any items that they don't already have. When they user returns home, they can access their saved list and review their trip. This project remains one of my proudest accomplishments and it's something I plan to keep up on, with the goal of one day selling the app to be integrated into REI's website and mobile application.",
